
The program is designed to process temperature sensor
data recorded line by line in a .csv file.
The program works from the console.
To build files and compile, you need to write the
"make" command in the console.
To run the program, you need to register the "prog"
command and the necessary key:
-h - display information about the program
-f (file name.csv) - the switch opens a file with
the same name for processing or displays an error
message. This key and file name are required for
the calculation
-m (month number) - to process only one entered month.
If this key is not entered, or the value after this
key does not correspond to a natural number from 1
to 12 inclusive, then the calculation will be made
for the whole year
